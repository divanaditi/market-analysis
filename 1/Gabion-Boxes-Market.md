Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on ensuring that the materials used in gabion box production are extracted responsibly, with minimal environmental impact. Ethical sourcing has also become a critical consideration for consumers, particularly in markets where eco-consciousness is a significant driver of purchasing decisions.
